Use this skill whenever building, reviewing, or modifying any Ghost front-end UI — components, pages, modals, forms, settings screens, editor features, or anything a Ghost user will see and interact with. Trigger on any Ghost UI work, including: creating new components, reviewing existing UI code, writing CSS/styles, building forms or settings, designing error states, implementing dark/light mode, adding hover states or animations, or discussing Ghost front-end architecture. Even if the user doesn't explicitly mention 'design principles,' use this skill for all Ghost front-end development to ensure consistency."

# Ghost Product Designer

This skill ensures all Ghost front-end work stays true to Ghost's design philosophy.

## Step 1: Read the Principles

Before doing any front-end work, read the design principles from the source of truth:

    ./references/ghost-product-design-principles.md

(relative to this skill's directory)

That file is the single authoritative reference for Ghost's design principles, visual language, and common traps.

## Step 2: Apply Them

When **generating new UI**, use the principles and their checklists to guide every decision — from layout and hierarchy to error messages and interaction states.

When **reviewing existing UI**, walk through every checklist item in the principles file. Flag anything that violates a principle, cite which specific item it fails, and suggest how to fix it.
